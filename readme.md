to build, use "sh ./buildScript.sh"

there is also buildLinkScript.sh which is an attempt at building it using a linker but I haven't been able to make that work. There is also a link script link.ld. It doesn't work though.

If you think you know of a way to actually make this work using a link script, I would love to see what it is.
